# markdown-to-html
Markdown to HTML converter with theme support.

##Installation
For some weird reason, npm won't pull my repository. Here is a quick workaround to get md2html:

1. `git clone https://github.com/forabi/markdown-to-html`
2. `cd markdown-to-html`
3. `npm install -g .` (may require sudo)

## Usage
`md2html <list of files> -o <output dir> --theme <theme name>`

## Themes
Two built-in theme, "thesis" and "thesis-j", are provided by default.
